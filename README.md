## About SAFEHer

SAFEHer is a comprehensive women's safety application developed initially as part of a hackathon at BMS College of Engineering, later re-worked and enhanced to create a complete production-ready solution. The application leverages modern technologies including AI-powered safety analysis to help women feel more secure when traveling alone.

## üîí Core Features

### Real-time Safety Tools
- **Voice Detection Alert**: Automatically detects distress keywords (like "help") and triggers emergency protocols
- **Shake Detection**: Shake your phone to trigger emergency alerts without unlocking your device
- **One-Touch Panic Button**: Instantly send your location and distress signal to emergency contacts

### Smart Navigation
- **AI-Powered Safe Route Planning**: Analyzes multiple routes and recommends the safest path based on real-time safety data
- **Location Safety Analysis**: Evaluates your current location and provides safety scores using Google's Gemini AI
- **Safety Tips**: Provides contextual safety recommendations for your specific route or location

### Emergency Response
- **Multi-Channel Alerts**: Sends emergency alerts through WhatsApp, SMS, and email
- **Live Location Sharing**: Shares precise GPS coordinates with emergency contacts
- **Automated Safety Analysis**: Continuously monitors surrounding areas as you move

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS templating
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with bcrypt
- **APIs**:
  - Google Maps JavaScript API for mapping and location services
  - Google Places API for location search and autocomplete
  - Google Gemini AI for safety analysis and route recommendations
- **Other Services**:
  - Email notifications
  - GPS location tracking
  - Voice recognition
  - Device motion detection

## üöÄ Installation & Setup
